I would like to dedicate this work to my grandparents. I was not able to stay by their side during their last days because I have been studying or working far away from my hometown since 2011. I grieve for their passing and have a lot of regrets. They were always caring about me and had a tremendous impact on me and the path that I chose. May them rest in peace.
