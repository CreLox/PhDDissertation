I am grateful to all members of my thesis committee, who have kindly lent their time and expertise to give me guidance, suggestions, and comments on my research for nearly six years.

My lab colleagues Palak Sekhri and Dr. Pavithra Aravamudhan laid the foundation of the eSAC work, which gave me a kickstart when I first joined the lab. I also want to acknowledge all other previous and current lab members (Dr. Alex Kukreja, Dr. Babhrubahan Roy, Dr. Vikash Verma, Dr. Arti Dumbrepatil, Lauren Humphrey, Rebekah Ronan, Simon Han,  Adrienne Fontan, Juan Orozco, Soubhagyalaxmi Jema, Sean McGuire, Martin Fernandez, Janice Sim, Frank Ferrari, Sisira Kavuri, Andrew Livingston, Anna Olson, and Shriya Karmarkar) who have supported my work in the lab by raising insightful questions, giving valuable suggestions, and building up a healthy and collaborative lab environment.

Many collaborators have taught me a lot about science and have greatly enhanced the impact of our research. They include (but are not limited to): Dr. Iain Cheeseman (Whitehead Institute); Dr. John Tyson and Dr. Anand Banerjee (Virginia Tech); Dr. Geert Kops (Hubrecht Institute, Netherlands); Dr. Andrea Musacchio and Dr. Valentina Piano (MPI of Molecular Physiology, Germany).

Many other friends and colleagues have helped me greatly in this endeavor, either by directly solving my technical problems or by providing key opinions or knowledge over the years. They include (but are not limited to): Dr. Mara Duncan (experimental techniques); Dr. J. Damon Hoff (fluorescence spectroscopy and associated data analysis); Dr. Dawei Yang (image processing and pattern recognition); Dr. Xiangtian Tan (bioinformatics); Dr. Uhn-Soo Cho as well as Dr. Sojin An and Dr. Jennifer Chik (molecular cloning and protein purification); Dr. Diane Fingar and Dr. Dubek Kazyken (kinase assay troubleshooting); Dr. Fengrong Wang and Dr. Takamasa Inoue (immuno-precipitation troubleshooting); Dr. Cindy DeLong (instructions on IncuCyte); Dr. Nigel Michki and Dr. Kyoung Jo (fluorescence imaging); Dr. Zhejian Ji (Spindle Assembly Checkpoint).

I would like to thank my mentors during my first-year rotations (Dr. Tom Kerppola and Dr. Wei Cheng). Although I did not join their labs, I am thankful for their close guidance at the early stage of my academic pursuit. Also, as a member of the Joglekar Lab, I have broadened my view through exchanges with members from Dr. Ryoma Ohi's lab and Dr. Uhn-Soo Cho's lab (with whom we have had joint lab meetings over the years).

Last but not the least, I could not have reached so far without the emotional support and mental inspiration of my family and best friends. They are my pole star and lighthouses in this epic voyage.
