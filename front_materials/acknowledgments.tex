I am grateful to all members of my thesis committee, who have kindly lent their time and expertise to give me guidance, suggestions, and comments on my research for nearly six years.

My mentor Dr. Ajit Joglekar and my lab colleagues (Palak Sekhri and Dr. Pavithra Aravamudhan) laid the foundation of the eSAC study (in Chapter \ref{chpt:2}), which gave me a kickstart when I first joined the lab in the summer of 2016. I also want to acknowledge all other previous and current lab colleagues (Dr. Alex Kukreja, Dr. Babhrubahan Roy, Dr. Vikash Verma, Dr. Arti Dumbrepatil, Lauren Humphrey-Stark, Rebekah Ronan, Simon Han,  Adrienne Fontan, Juan Orozco, Soubhagyalaxmi Jema, Sean McGuire, Martin Fernandez, Janice Sim, Frank Ferrari, Alex Vita, Sisira Kavuri, Andrew Livingston, Anna Olson, and Shriya Karmarkar) who have supported my work in the lab by directly participating in my research (which is properly credited in corresponding parts of the main text of this thesis), raising insightful questions, offering valuable suggestions, and building up a healthy environment.

Many collaborators have taught me a lot about science and have greatly enhanced the impact of our research. They include (but are not limited to): Dr. Iain Cheeseman (Whitehead Institute); Dr. John Tyson and Dr. Anand Banerjee (Virginia Tech); Dr. Geert Kops (Hubrecht Institute, Netherlands); Dr. Song-Tao Liu and Dr. Yibo Luo (University of Toledo); Dr. Andrea Musacchio and Dr. Valentina Piano (MPI of Molecular Physiology, Germany).

Many other friends and colleagues have helped me greatly in this endeavor, either by directly solving my technical problems or by providing key opinions or knowledge over the years. They include (but are not limited to): Dr. Mara Duncan (experimental techniques); Dr. J. Damon Hoff (fluorescence spectroscopy and associated data analysis); Dr. Dawei Yang (image processing and pattern recognition); Dr. Xiangtian Tan (bioinformatics); Dr. Uhn-Soo Cho as well as Dr. Sojin An and Dr. Jennifer Chik (molecular cloning and protein purification); Dr. Diane Fingar and Dr. Dubek Kazyken (kinase assay troubleshooting); Dr. Fengrong Wang and Dr. Takamasa Inoue (immuno-precipitation troubleshooting); Dr. Cindy DeLong (instructions on IncuCyte ZOOM); Dr. Nigel Michki and Dr. Kyoung Jo (fluorescence imaging); Dr. Priya Amin and Dr. Zhejian Ji (spindle assembly checkpoint). There are many others who provided me with necessary reagents and instruments, whose assistance was or will be acknowledged in my published paper \cite{eSAC} and manuscripts under preparation.

I would like to thank my mentors during my first-year rotations (Dr. Tom Kerppola and Dr. Wei Cheng). Although I did not join their labs in the end, I am thankful for their close guidance at the early stage of my academic pursuit. Also, I have broadened my view through exchanges with many members from Dr. Ryoma Ohi's lab and Dr. Uhn-Soo Cho's lab.

Last but not the least, I could not have reached so far without the emotional support and mental inspiration of my family and friends. They are my pole star and lighthouses in this memorable voyage.
