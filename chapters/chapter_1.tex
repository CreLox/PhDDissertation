\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chpt:introduction}

Somatic cell division generates two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. Among different stages of the cell cycle, my thesis focus on mitosis. Mitosis follows the conclusion of the interphase (during which nuclear DNAs are duplicated) and can be further divided into the prophase, the prometaphase (after the nuclear envelop breakdown and before all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, which is the main stage of my thesis), the metaphase, the anaphase, and the telophase \cite{MBC4}.

To generate two genetically identical daughter cells, duplicated nuclear DNAs packed within chromosomes need to be distributed into the two daughter cells equally. This requires that each duplicated chromosome is stably attached to spindle microtubules emanating from the two opposite poles of the parent cell before the parent cell divides. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) serves as a surveillance mechanism that monitors the completion of this process and prevents the premature onset of the anaphase, thereby avoiding chromosome missegregation \cite{MBC4}.

The SAC can robustly delay the onset of the anaphase in the presence of a single chromosome with monopolar attachment \cite{PtK1SingleUnattachedKT}. The question I want to address through my thesis research is how the SAC achieves such sensitivity. Through my extensive studies, I discovered that the SAC exploits cooperativity to achieve such sensitivity. In this chapter, some of the basic facts, important concepts, and motivations of my thesis research will be introduced to prepare my dear readers for later chapters.

\section{Spindle, kinetochore, and kinetochore-microtubule attachment}

To prepare for the equal distribution of duplicated nuclear DNAs packed within chromosomes, a mitotic cell forms the spindle (see the green structure in \myref{SACRole}) whose microtubules attach to chromosomes from opposite poles of the cell. The adaptor structures on chromosomes which mediate such attachment are named kinetochores. After all chromosomes are bipolarly attached to the spindle and aligned at the metaphase plate (through a process named ``chromosome congression'' \cite{ChromosomeCongression}), the cell will enter the anaphase when sister chromatids separate from each other. The spindle will then pull the two sets of chromosomes towards opposite poles of the cell, which later become parts of the two daughter cells \cite{MBC4}.

In most vertebrates, kinetochores range between 0.1--\SI{0.5}{\micro m} in diameter \cite{Rieder+Salmon1998}. The architecture of human kinetochores is proposed to resemble a Velcro-like interface, forming adaptable attachment sites for an average number of about 17 microtubules in the metaphase \cite{Wendell1993, Zaytsev2014, Zaytsev2015, Velcro, Kukreja2020}. There are two different modes of kinetochore-microtubule attachment in human cells: the lateral attachment and the end-on attachment (see \myref{SACRole}). The establishment of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment is a gradual and stochastic process \cite{GradualStochastic}.

Around a kinetochore in human cells, a crescent-shaped fibrous meshwork named the corona is assembled \cite{CoronaReview_Kops+Gassman2020}. It is formed through the polymerization of the ROD-Zwilch-ZW10-Spindly (RZZS) complex \cite{RZZS_Sacristan2018} and is stripped off the kinetochore by dynein at the establishment of microtubule attachment \cite{DyneinStripsCorona}. The corona expands the microtubule-attachment interface of a kinetochore and thereby facilitates the initial microtubule capture. The corona recruits the centromere-associated kinesin \protein{Cenp-E}, which promotes the conversion of lateral attachment into the desired end-on attachment \cite{Corona-CENP-E_Yao1997, GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment, CENPEActivity-BUBR1}. The corona also recruits \protein{Cenp-F} which may contribute to the stability of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment and limits the dynein-mediated stripping of the corona \cite{CENP-FLimitsStripping}.

% Due to the facts that mammalian kinetochore may bind to more than one microtubules during the metaphase and that there are two spindle poles from which the kinetochore microtubules may emanate, even if the end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachment has been fully established, it could still be erroneous. These undesired attachment modes are named syntelic and merotelic attachment. In syntelic attachment, both kinetochores on a duplicated chromosome attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. In merotelic attachment, a single kinetochore form attachment to microtubules emanating from both spindle poles. Cells deploy error-correction mechanisms to correct these erroneous attachment modes.

    \noindent\justifying In an ordinary human somatic cell during mitosis, 46 chromosomes gradually attach to the spindle during the prometaphase. Kinetochores without end-on microtubule attachment activate the SAC to prevent premature anaphase onset, ensuring equal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells. Diagrams of the two modes of kinetochore-microtubule attachment (lateral vs end-on) are shown on the top right.

\section{The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling in human cells: the core pathway and the corona pathway}

Cells deploy the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to monitor the progress of the establishment of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment during the prometaphase. The SAC is activated at kinetochores without end-on microtubule attachment to block premature anaphase onset \cite{GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment, GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM, LateralAttachmentSAC}. This block allows time for the establishment of the end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Once all attachment is secured, the SAC is silenced and the block is lifted \cite{SACActivationAndSilencing}. Mitosis is then resumed, heading toward equal segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells (see \myref{SACRole}).

The SAC in mammalian cells relies on the kinetochore-localized signaling scaffold \protein{Knl1} as well as the corona \cite{GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM, LateralAttachmentSAC, CoronaActivatesSAC}. We refer to them as the core pathway (which will be the main focus of my thesis; see \myref{CoreSAC}) and the corona pathway, respectively \cite{100nMNoc, eSAC}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.94\textwidth]{chapters/figures/CoreSAC.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{The biochemical interactions and reactions of the core SAC signaling pathway.}}
    \noindent\justifying In the core SAC signaling pathway, signaling kinetochores recruit the kinase \protein{Mps1} which phosphorylates the consensus MELT motifs on the scaffold protein \protein{Knl1}. Phosphorylated MELT motifs (the ``MELpT'' rectangle in the figure) will then recruit a series of SAC proteins and eventually generate the effector molecule known as the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC), which blocks the progression of mitosis. \protein{Cdc20} binds to signaling kinetochores cooperatively via its interactions with \protein{Bub1} and \protein{Mad1} \cite{BUB1-CDC20-MAD1, Tripartite}. Black solid arrows indicate direct binding or participation, which is either the consensus understanding in the field \cite{MPS1Localization_Ji, MPS1Localization_Hiruma, RecombinantKNL1, MELTActivity, BubBiochem, BubR1TwoPools, BUB1CD1-MAD1CStructure, Faesen2017, BUB1-CDC20-MAD1, Tripartite} or experimentally proved in my thesis research (see \myref{per_se}). Black dashed arrows indicate arguable \cite{BubBiochem, BubR1TwoPools} or hypothetical direct binding or participation. Magenta arrows and texts indicate \protein{Mps1} or involvement of \protein{Mps1}-mediated phosphorylation \cite{Ji2017eLife}. The orange arrow indicates catalytic reactions leading to the formation of the \protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2} dimer, which will be the focus of \myref{chpt:4}. The green \protein{Mad1} oval indicates the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer (see \myref{chpt:4}). This heterotetramer is extremely stable in the budding yeast \cite{StableHeterotetramer}. The molecular weight of \protein{Mad1} (an extended protein mainly composed of \textalpha{}-helices according to the prediction of AlphaFold \cite{AlphaFold}) is also much greater than the molecular weight of \protein{Mad2} (a globular protein \cite{Structure1GO4}). Therefore, the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer is also sometimes simply referred to as ``\protein{Mad1}'' in the following context.
    \label{CoreSAC}
\end{figure}

The core SAC signaling pathway is scaffolded by \protein{Knl1} localized at all kinetochores. The human \protein{Knl1} possesses 19 consensus MELT motifs in its mostly discordered N-terminus and middle region \cite{MELTEvolution}, some of which are phosphorylated by the kinase \protein{Mps1} localized at signaling kinetochores \cite{MPS1-KNL1_London2012, MPS1-KNL1_Shepperd2012, MPS1-KNL1_Yamagishi2012, MPS1Localization_Ji, MPS1Localization_Hiruma}. These phosphorylated MELT motifs initiate the core SAC signaling pathway by recruiting SAC proteins like \protein{Bub3}, \protein{Bub1}, \protein{BubR1}, \protein{Cdc20}, and the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer, thereby promoting the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of \protein{BubR1}/\protein{BubR1}-\protein{Bub3} and \protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2} \cite{RecombinantKNL1, MELTActivity, BubBiochem, BubR1TwoPools, BUB1CD1-MAD1CStructure, Faesen2017, BUB1-CDC20-MAD1, Tripartite, SpMCC}. The mitotic checkpoint complex inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) \cite{APC-MCC_Alfieri2016, APC-MCC_Yamaguchi2016}. APC/C ubiquitinates Cyclin B1, a key mitosis regulator, thereby targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation \cite{CyclinB1Degradation_Clute+Pines1999, CyclinB1Degradation_Chang2003, SeparaseStructure}. Through the inhibition of the APC/C, the degradation of Cyclin B1 is suppressed and the onset of anaphase is delayed.

In the corona pathway of the SAC signaling, the corona recruits the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer to signaling kinetochores and promotes the SAC signaling activity \cite{CoronaActivatesSAC}. It should be noted that the core pathway and the corona pathway are not independent in human cells. Corona constituents \protein{Cenp-E} and \protein{Cenp-F} interact with core SAC pathway components \protein{BubR1} and \protein{Bub1}, respectively \cite{CENPELocalization-BUBR1, CENP-FLimitsStripping}. It has also been suggested that the recruitment of \protein{Mad1} to signaling kinetochores may be cooperative, facilitated by both the corona and \protein{Bub1} \cite{MIS12-CEP57-MAD1-MAD2, siROD_Zhang2019}. We conceptually separate the two pathways because the corona does not exist in the budding yeast, while the core pathway is conserved from yeast to human \cite{YeastNoRZZ}.

\section{The sensitivity and responsiveness of the SAC}
\label{Sensitivity+Responsiveness}

The SAC signaling activity is positively correlated with the total number of signaling kinetochores \cite{RiederNormalProgression, Rheostat, Ablation}. However, even a single unattached kinetochore delays anaphase onset in a mammalian somatic cell line \cite{PtK1SingleUnattachedKT}. Understanding how the SAC achieves such sensitivity requires a quantitative and systematic examination of the SAC signaling pathway.

Signaling pathways may boost its sensitivity to a modest input by many mechanisms. Some signaling pathways amplify the input via biochemical reactions while some attain ultrasensitivity featuring a switch-like sigmoidal dose-response relationship (see \myref{CurveTypes}). Due to the probable lack of amplification mechanisms in the SAC signaling pathway (see the caption of \myref{SACNoAmplification} for detailed explanations), my focus is to study whether and how the SAC realizes ultrasensitivity.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{\textbf{Many mechanisms may realize the sensitivity of a signaling pathway to a modest input.}}
    \noindent\justifying 
    (A) A signaling pathway may boost its sensitivity to a modest input by signal amplification (via, for example, a second messenger, a catalytic cascade, positive feedback, or the central dogma; the blue curve) or ultrasensitivity (the red curve). The blue curve is derived by compressing the vanilla relationship of the Langmuir adsorption equation and Michaelis-Menten kinetics (the black curve) in the horizontal direction by the amplification factor. (B) Many well-characterized signal amplification mechanisms do not apply to the SAC. The smallest molecule in the core SAC signaling pathway (other than the ATPs in the phosphorylation reactions; see \myref{CoreSAC}) is \protein{Mad2}, whose canonical isoform (\SI{23.5}{kDa}) is still much larger than typical second messengers (although \protein{Mad2} undergoes a conformational change facilitated by a catalytic reaction and regulates mitosis independently of the MCC by binding to many other proteins \cite{Separase-SGO2-MAD2, KIF20A-MAD2}, which will be discussed in \myref{chpt:4}). No catalytic cascade has been identified that could amplify the SAC signaling activity. Also, there has been no report on positive feedback in the core SAC signaling pathway (while several cases of negative feedback regulations have been indicated \cite{Mps1pAutophosphorylation, PP2ADephosphorylatesBUB1, PP2ADephosphorylatesKNL1, PP2A-B56}). Finally, transcriptional regulations that amplify inputs through the central dogma (or realize ultrasensitivity through the potential oligomerization or allosteric regulations of the transcriptional factors \cite{TFMultimerization, TFAllostericRegulation}) are also unlikely because the genome is highly condensed during the prometaphase.
    \label{SensitivityMechanisms}
\end{figure}

After all chromosomes are attached to spindle microtubules, the SAC is silenced and the block inflicted on the progression of mitosis is lifted \cite{PP2A-B56, DyneinStripsCorona, BubR1MitosisTurnover, CCT-MCCDisassembly, Ubiquitylation-MCCDisassembly, UBR5-MCCDisassembly, TRIP13-p31-MAD2, APC-SUMO}. Sister chromatids separate from each other in about half an hour in a mammalian cell line \cite{RiederNormalProgression}, demonstrating the responsiveness of the SAC. It is important to note that during normal mitosis, the prometaphase arrest is released without all kinetochores fulfilling their maximum microtubule-binding capacity. There are also a considerable amount of certain SAC proteins remaining at metaphase and anaphase kinetochores \cite{SACSilencing_Etemad2019, SACSilencing_Kuhn2019}.

% The silencing of the SAC is mainly mediated by (1) the dephosphorylation of the MELT motifs on \protein{Knl1} by phosphatases as well as the shedding of the corona, which ceases the assembly of the MCC \cite{PP2A-B56, DyneinStripsCorona} and (2) the disassembly or degradation of existing MCCs \cite{BubR1MitosisTurnover, CCT-MCCDisassembly, Ubiquitylation-MCCDisassembly, UBR5-MCCDisassembly, TRIP13-p31-MAD2} and (3) the attenuation of the affinity between the MCC and the APC/C \cite{APC-SUMO}.

Although the responsiveness of the SAC is not the focus of my thesis, the sensitivity and responsiveness of the SAC are like two sides of the same coin. Understanding the origin of the sensitivity and responsiveness of the SAC and their balancing (see the discussions in \myref{eSACDiscussions}) will help us better comprehend how the SAC activates to prevent premature anaphase onset in the presence of a decreasing number of signaling kinetochores and silences to initiate anaphase onset after all chromosomes are attached to spindle microtubules promptly during normal mitosis.

\section{Cooperativity is one way to realize ultrasensitivity}

The widely applicable Langmuir adsorption equation and Michaelis-Menten kinetics in biochemical interactions or reactions commonly inflict a dampening effect on any changes in the input \cite{CooperativityQA}. To explain such dampening effect, suppose that the output $f(x) \geq 0$ is a monotonically increasing and strictly concave function of the input $x$ for all $x \geq 0$ (like the Langmuir adsorption equation and Michaelis-Menten kinetics) and that the output is 0 if and only if the input is 0. Comparing the outputs [$f(x_2)$ and $f(x_1)$] corresponding to the inputs ($x_2 > x_1 > 0$), we have

\begin{equation*}
    1 < \dfrac{f(x_2)}{f(x_1)} = \dfrac{f(x_2)}{f[\dfrac{x_1}{x_2} \cdot x_2 + (1-\dfrac{x_1}{x_2}) \cdot 0]} < \dfrac{f(x_2)}{\dfrac{x_1}{x_2}f(x_2) + (1-\dfrac{x_1}{x_2})f(0)} = \dfrac{x_2}{x_1},
\end{equation*}

\noindent which states that the contrast between the outputs is less than the contrast between the inputs \cite{InhibitorUltrasensitivity}.

There are many well-studied mechanisms deployed by signaling cascades exhibiting ultrasensitivity to circumvent the dampening effect and sensitize the output \cite{ZeroOrder, MultistepUltrasensitivity, Bistability}. For example, the multi-step/multi-site phosphorylation mechanism has been implied in the SAC by experimental evidence \cite{Ji2017eLife} (see the magenta arrows and texts in \myref{CoreSAC}). The advantage of the sigmoidal dose-response relationship in the case of ultrasensitivity (red curve), compared to the straight-forward signal amplification, is that the signaling response is also robust against a small noise (during the activation stage) or residue (during the deactivation stage) in the input (see \myref{CurveTypes}), which may contribute to the responsiveness of the SAC.

Here in my thesis, I will focus on the implied role of cooperativity in the SAC signaling. Cooperativity is one way to realize ultrasensitivity and was originally used to describe the binding of oxygen molecules to the multi-subunit hemoglobin \cite{KNF, MWC}. Hereafter, I will use the term ``positive cooperativity'' (or simply ``cooperativity'') to describe the phenomenological synergy, which I attribute to the increased local concentration of SAC proteins due to their co-localization on the same signaling scaffold (see the descriptions of the proposed models in \myref{ProzoneEffectModel,FinalKnittingModel}). This is reminiscent of the theoretical explanation of the avidity between antibodies and antigens \cite{AvidityMath}, another well-characterized example of cooperativity.

\section{Studying the SAC quantitatively \Latin{in vivo}: experimental methods and technical challenges}
\label{TechnicalChallenges}

% The understanding of the entire picture is hindered by multiple difficulties. First, the biochemical reactions that lead to MCC formation are spatially localized within the nanoscale volume of a kinetochore. Second, the concentrations of many SAC proteins are tightly regulated and may be influenced by each other. Third, that the biochemical cascade involves complex parallel recruitment pathways of certain SAC proteins and regulating kinases/phosphatases. 

% refer to sections and chapters!

%To study the quantitative relationship between the strength of the SAC signaling and the number of signaling kinetochores/the amount of SAC proteins localized to signaling kinetochores, The SAC was then activated by treating the cells with either GSK923295 or a high dosage of nocodazole. GSK923295 inhibits the ATPase activity of \protein{Cenp-E}, thereby disrupting chromosome congression and yielding small numbers of chromosomes near spindle poles in mammalian cells \cite{GSK923295}.

%These polar chromosomes typically possess one kinetochore that is unattached or laterally attached to spindle microtubules, both of which activate the SAC in mammalian cells \cite{GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment,GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM,LateralAttachmentSAC}.

% Monastrol co-treatment may have created the bias towards unattachment instead of lateral attachment.

%Nocodazole affects the dynamics of microtubules and distorts spindles at \SI{330}{nM} in human cells \cite{TypeIIISpindle_330nMNoc, RPE1+Noc}, turning on SAC signaling at almost all kinetochores based on the recruitment of SAC proteins (see below). We applied various fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to quantify SAC proteins and their influence on the SAC in live cells \cite{eSAC}. % Small numbers of signaling kinetochores and relative enrichment of SAC proteins on them.

%This chromosome congression-promoting function complicates the quantitative study of the SAC signaling output in live cells.
