\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chpt:introduction}

Somatic cell division generates two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. Among different stages of the cell cycle, my thesis focus on mitosis. Mitosis follows the conclusion of the interphase (during which nuclear DNAs are duplicated) and can be further divided into the prophase, the prometaphase (after the nuclear envelop breakdown and before all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, which is the main stage of my thesis), the metaphase, the anaphase, and the telophase \cite{MBC4}.

To generate two genetically identical daughter cells, duplicated nuclear DNAs packed within chromosomes need to be distributed into the two daughter cells equally. This requires that each duplicated chromosome is stably attached to spindle microtubules emanating from the two opposite poles of the parent cell before the parent cell divides. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) serves as a surveillance mechanism that monitors the completion of this process and prevents the premature onset of the anaphase, thereby avoiding chromosome missegregation \cite{MBC4}.

The SAC can robustly delay the onset of the anaphase in the presence of a single chromosome with monopolar attachment \cite{PtK1SingleUnattachedKT}. The question I want to address through my thesis research is how the SAC achieves such sensitivity. Through my extensive studies, I discovered that the SAC exploits cooperativity to achieve such sensitivity. In this chapter, some of the basic facts, important concepts, and motivations of my thesis research will be introduced to prepare my dear readers for later chapters.

\section{Spindle, kinetochore, and kinetochore-microtubule attachment}

To prepare for the equal distribution of duplicated nuclear DNAs packed within chromosomes, a mitotic cell forms the spindle (see the green structure in \myref{SACRole}) whose microtubules attach to chromosomes from opposite poles of the cell. The adaptor structures on chromosomes which mediate such attachment are named kinetochores. After all chromosomes are bipolarly attached to the spindle and aligned at the metaphase plate (through a process named ``chromosome congression'' \cite{ChromosomeCongression}), the cell will enter the anaphase when sister chromatids separate from each other. The spindle will then pull the two sets of chromosomes towards opposite poles of the cell, which later become parts of the two daughter cells \cite{MBC4}.

In most vertebrates, kinetochores range between 0.1--\SI{0.5}{\micro m} in diameter \cite{Rieder+Salmon1998}. The architecture of human kinetochores is proposed to resemble a Velcro-like interface, forming adaptable attachment sites for an average number of about 17 microtubules in the metaphase \cite{Wendell1993, Zaytsev2014, Zaytsev2015, Velcro, Kukreja2020}. There are two different modes of kinetochore-microtubule attachment in human cells: the lateral attachment and the end-on attachment (see \myref{SACRole}). The establishment of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment is a gradual and stochastic process \cite{GradualStochastic}.

Around a kinetochore in human cells, a crescent-shaped fibrous meshwork named the corona is assembled \cite{CoronaReview_Kops+Gassman2020}. It is formed through the polymerization of the ROD-Zwilch-ZW10-Spindly (RZZS) complex \cite{RZZS_Sacristan2018} and is stripped off the kinetochore by dynein at the establishment of microtubule attachment \cite{DyneinStripsCorona}. The corona expands the microtubule-attachment interface of a kinetochore and thereby facilitates the initial microtubule capture. The corona recruits the centromere-associated kinesin \protein{Cenp-E}, which promotes the conversion of lateral attachment into the desired end-on attachment \cite{Corona-CENP-E_Yao1997, GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment, CENPEActivity-BUBR1}. The corona also recruits \protein{Cenp-F} which may contribute to the stability of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment and limits the dynein-mediated stripping of the corona \cite{CENP-FLimitsStripping}.

% Due to the facts that mammalian kinetochore may bind to more than one microtubules during the metaphase and that there are two spindle poles from which the kinetochore microtubules may emanate, even if the end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachment has been fully established, it could still be erroneous. These undesired attachment modes are named syntelic and merotelic attachment. In syntelic attachment, both kinetochores on a duplicated chromosome attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. In merotelic attachment, a single kinetochore form attachment to microtubules emanating from both spindle poles. Cells deploy error-correction mechanisms to correct these erroneous attachment modes.

    \noindent\justifying In an ordinary human somatic cell during mitosis, 46 chromosomes gradually attach to the spindle during the prometaphase. Kinetochores without end-on microtubule attachment activate the SAC to prevent premature anaphase onset, ensuring equal distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells. Many well-characterized signal amplification mechanisms do not apply to the SAC (see the discussions in \myref{Sensitivity}).

\section{The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling in human cells: the core pathway and the corona pathway}

Cells deploy the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to monitor the progress of the establishment of the kinetochore-microtubule attachment during the prometaphase. The SAC is activated at kinetochores without end-on microtubule attachment to block premature anaphase onset \cite{GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment, GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM, LateralAttachmentSAC}. This block allows time for the establishment of the end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Once all attachment is secured, the SAC is silenced and the block is lifted \cite{SACActivationAndSilencing}. Mitosis is then resumed, heading toward equal segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells (see \myref{SACRole}).

The SAC can be activated by a single unattached kinetochore, and the strength of the signaling activity is positively correlated with the number of signaling kinetochores in mammalian cells \cite{RiederNormalProgression, Rheostat, Ablation}. The SAC in mammalian cells relies on the kinetochore-localized signaling scaffold \protein{Knl1} as well as the corona \cite{GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM, LateralAttachmentSAC, CoronaActivatesSAC}. We refer to them as the core pathway (which will be the main focus of my thesis; see \myref{CoreSAC}) and the corona pathway, respectively \cite{100nMNoc, eSAC}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.94\textwidth]{chapters/figures/CoreSAC.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{The biochemical interactions and reactions of the core SAC signaling pathway.}}
    \noindent\justifying In the core SAC signaling pathway, signaling kinetochores recruit the kinase \protein{Mps1} which phosphorylates the consensus MELT motifs on the scaffold protein \protein{Knl1}. Phosphorylated MELT motifs (the ``MELpT'' rectangle in the figure) will then recruit a series of SAC proteins and eventually generate the effector molecule known as the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC), which blocks the progression of mitosis. \protein{Cdc20} binds to signaling kinetochores cooperatively via its interactions with \protein{Bub1} and \protein{Mad1} \cite{BUB1-CDC20-MAD1, Tripartite}. Black solid arrows indicate direct binding or participation, which is either the consensus understanding in the field \cite{MPS1Localization_Ji, MPS1Localization_Hiruma, RecombinantKNL1, MELTActivity, BubBiochem, BubR1TwoPools, BUB1CD1-MAD1CStructure, Faesen2017, BUB1-CDC20-MAD1, Tripartite} or experimentally proved in my thesis research (see \myref{per_se}). Black dashed arrows indicate arguable \cite{BubBiochem, BubR1TwoPools} or hypothetical direct binding or participation. Magenta arrows and texts indicate \protein{Mps1} or involvement of \protein{Mps1}-mediated phosphorylation \cite{Ji2017eLife}. The orange arrow indicates catalytic reactions leading to the formation of the \protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2} dimer, which will be the focus of \myref{chpt:4}. The green \protein{Mad1} oval indicates the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer (see \myref{chpt:4}). This heterotetramer is extremely stable in the budding yeast \cite{StableHeterotetramer}. The molecular weight of \protein{Mad1} (an extended protein mainly composed of \textalpha{}-helices according to the prediction of AlphaFold \cite{AlphaFold}) is also much greater than the molecular weight of \protein{Mad2} (a globular protein \cite{Structure1GO4}). Therefore, the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer is also sometimes simply referred to as ``\protein{Mad1}'' in the following context.
    \label{CoreSAC}
\end{figure}

Human \protein{Knl1} possesses 19 putative consensus MELT motifs \cite{MELTEvolution}, some of which are phosphorylated at signaling kinetochores \cite{MPS1-KNL1_London2012, MPS1-KNL1_Shepperd2012, MPS1-KNL1_Yamagishi2012, MPS1Localization_Ji, MPS1Localization_Hiruma}. Phosphorylated MELT motifs initiate the core SAC signaling pathway by recruiting SAC proteins like \protein{Bub3}, \protein{Bub1}, \protein{BubR1}, \protein{Cdc20}, and the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer, thereby promoting the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of \protein{BubR1}/\protein{BubR1}-\protein{Bub3} and \protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2} \cite{RecombinantKNL1, MELTActivity, BubBiochem, BubR1TwoPools, BUB1CD1-MAD1CStructure, Faesen2017, BUB1-CDC20-MAD1, Tripartite, SpMCC}. The mitotic checkpoint complex inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) \cite{APC-MCC_Alfieri2016, APC-MCC_Yamaguchi2016}. APC/C ubiquitinates Cyclin B1, a key mitosis regulator, thereby targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation \cite{CyclinB1Degradation_Clute+Pines1999, CyclinB1Degradation_Chang2003, SeparaseStructure}. Through the inhibition of the APC/C, the degradation of Cyclin B1 is suppressed and the onset of anaphase is delayed.

In the corona pathway of the SAC signaling, the corona recruits the \protein{Mad1}-\protein{Mad2} heterotetramer to signaling kinetochores and promotes the SAC signaling activity \cite{CoronaActivatesSAC}. It should be noted that the core pathway and the corona pathway are not independent in human cells. Corona constituents \protein{Cenp-E} and \protein{Cenp-F} interact with core SAC pathway components \protein{BubR1} and \protein{Bub1}, respectively \cite{CENPELocalization-BUBR1, CENP-FLimitsStripping}. It has also been suggested that the recruitment of \protein{Mad1} to signaling kinetochores may be cooperative, facilitated by both the corona and \protein{Bub1} \cite{MIS12-CEP57-MAD1-MAD2, siROD_Zhang2019}. We conceptually separate the two pathways because the corona does not exist in the budding yeast, while the core pathway is conserved from yeast to human \cite{YeastNoRZZ}.

\section{The sensitivity and responsiveness of the SAC}
\label{Sensitivity}
% Just like one will not completely understand how a machine works just by knowing all the gears involved, we cannot claim to have completely comprehended how the SAC works by just knowing all associated biochemical reactions individually. How the number of signaling kinetochores changes the strength of the signaling output is not fully understood.

% sensitivity

% responsiveness (releasing the block promptly once all attachment is secured)

% amplification vs ultrasensitivity: The smallest molecule in the core SAC signaling pathway (other than the ATP required in phosphorylation reactions; see \myref{CoreSAC}) is \protein{Mad2}. Although \protein{Mad2} regulates mitosis independently of the MCC by binding to other proteins (\cite{Separase-SGO2-MAD2, KIF20A-MAD2}), its canonical isoform (with a molecular weight of \SI{23.5}{kDa}) is still much larger than typical second messengers. No enzymatic amplification cascade has been identified that may amplify the SAC activity in the presence of a single signaling kinetochore. Transcriptional regulations that amplify signals via the central dogma or realize ultrasensitivity through the potential oligomerization of transcriptional factors \cite{TFMultimerization} are also unlikely because the genome is highly condensed during the prometaphase.

% Understanding the origin of the sensitivity and responsiveness of the SAC will help us comprehend how the SAC prevents premature anaphase onset in the presence of a decreasing number of signaling kinetochores from the nuclear envelope breakdown to the metaphase during normal mitotic progression.

\section{Cooperativity is one way to realize ultrasensitivity}

Originally, ``cooperativity'' was used to describe the binding of oxygen molecules to the multi-subunit hemoglobin \cite{KNF, MWC}. Cooperativity may amplify the signal or at least sensitize the output by reducing the dampening effect of any changes in the input \cite{CooperativityQA}. To explain such dampening effect, suppose that the output $f(x) \geq 0$ is a monotonically increasing and strictly concave function of the input $x$ for all $x \geq 0$ (like the Langmuir adsorption equation or the Michaelis-Menten kinetics) and that the output is 0 if and only if the input is 0. Comparing the outputs [$f(x_2)$ and $f(x_1)$] corresponding to the inputs ($x_2 > x_1 > 0$), we have

\begin{equation*}
    1 < \dfrac{f(x_2)}{f(x_1)} = \dfrac{f(x_2)}{f[\dfrac{x_1}{x_2} \cdot x_2 + (1-\dfrac{x_1}{x_2}) \cdot 0]} < \dfrac{f(x_2)}{\dfrac{x_1}{x_2}f(x_2) + (1-\dfrac{x_1}{x_2})f(0)} = \dfrac{x_2}{x_1},
\end{equation*}

\noindent which states that the contrast between the outputs is less than the contrast between the inputs \cite{InhibitorUltrasensitivity}. Due to the wide applicability of the Langmuir adsorption equation or the Michaelis-Menten kinetics in biochemical interactions or reactions, the dampening effect may be very common.

There are many well-studied mechanisms (including cooperativity) deployed by signaling cascades exhibiting a switch-like sigmoidal dose-response relationship (ultrasensitivity) to circumvent the dampening effect. For example, the multi-step/multi-site phosphorylation mechanism has been implied in the SAC by experimental evidence \cite{MultistepUltrasensitivity, Ji2017eLife} (see the magenta arrows and texts in \myref{CoreSAC}). My thesis will focus on the implied role of cooperativity in the SAC signaling. The term ``positive cooperativity'' (henceforth simply referred to as ``cooperativity'') describes the phenomenological synergy which I attribute to the increased local concentration of SAC proteins due to their co-localization on the same signaling scaffold (see my models in \myref{ProzoneEffectModel,FinalKnittingModel}). This is reminiscent of the theoretical explanation of the avidity between antibodies and antigens \cite{AvidityMath}, another well-characterized example of cooperativity.

% Regarding the SAC signaling, certain mechanisms (like the cascade amplification mechanism; see \myref{SACRole}) may be excluded based on our current understanding of mitosis and the biochemical pathway of the SAC, while

\section{Studying the SAC quantitatively \Latin{in vivo}: experimental methods and technical challenges}
\label{TechnicalChallenges}

% The understanding of the entire picture is hindered by multiple difficulties. First, the biochemical reactions that lead to MCC formation are spatially localized within the nanoscale volume of a kinetochore. Second, the concentrations of many SAC proteins are tightly regulated and may be influenced by each other. Third, that the biochemical cascade involves complex parallel recruitment pathways of certain SAC proteins and regulating kinases/phosphatases.

%To study the quantitative relationship between the strength of the SAC signaling and the number of signaling kinetochores/the amount of SAC proteins localized to signaling kinetochores, The SAC was then activated by treating the cells with either GSK923295 or a high dosage of nocodazole. GSK923295 inhibits the ATPase activity of \protein{Cenp-E}, thereby disrupting chromosome congression and yielding small numbers of chromosomes near spindle poles in mammalian cells \cite{GSK923295}.

%These polar chromosomes typically possess one kinetochore that is unattached or laterally attached to spindle microtubules, both of which activate the SAC in mammalian cells \cite{GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment,GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM,LateralAttachmentSAC}.

% Monastrol co-treatment may have created the bias towards unattachment instead of lateral attachment.

%Nocodazole affects the dynamics of microtubules and distorts spindles at \SI{330}{nM} in human cells \cite{TypeIIISpindle_330nMNoc, RPE1+Noc}, turning on SAC signaling at almost all kinetochores based on the recruitment of SAC proteins (see below). We applied various fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to quantify SAC proteins and their influence on the SAC in live cells \cite{eSAC}. % Small numbers of signaling kinetochores and relative enrichment of SAC proteins on them.

%This chromosome congression-promoting function complicates the quantitative study of the SAC signaling output in live cells.
