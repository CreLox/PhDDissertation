%  How the SAC blocks the progression of mitosis in the presence of a single unattached kinetochore and releases the block promptly once all attachment is secured remains unclear. Here, I summarize our discovery that the SAC, like many other biochemical switches, exploits cooperativity to achieve such sensitivity. Furthermore, I look into potential molecular mechanisms of this cooperativity.

% Unattached kinetochores catalyze MCC formation by recruiting SAC proteins in a well-defined signaling cascade (Fig. 1A) (Faesen et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2017; Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2021a; London and Biggins, 2014; London et al., 2012; Piano et al., 2021; Primorac et al., 2013; Shepperd et al., 2012). This cascade is activated when the kinetochore protein Knl1 is phosphorylated by the Mps1 kinase at the ‘MELT’ motifs, so called because of their consensus amino acid sequence in humans and other eukaryotes (Primorac et al., 2013; Tromer et al., 2015; Vleugel et al., 2013). Each MELT motif serves as the scaffold for recruiting downstream signaling proteins (Chen et al., 2019; Primorac et al., 2013).

% Accurate chromosome segregation during cell division requires that the sister kinetochores on each replicated chromosome are stably attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles before the cell divides. If one or more kinetochores fail to attach to microtubules, they activate a biochemical signaling cascade known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This cascade produces an anaphase-inhibitory signal known as the ‘‘mitotic checkpoint complex’’ (MCC). MCC in- hibits the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to prevent the cell from transitioning from prometaphase to anaphase, thus avoiding chromosome mis-segregation [2].

    \noindent\justifying The sensitivity of the SAC is unlikely to be facilitated by an enzymatic amplification cascade, given our current understanding of the biochemical pathway of the SAC \cite{InhibitorUltrasensitivity, Caspase}. Transcriptional regulations that amplify signals via the central dogma and the potential oligomerization of the involved transcriptional factors \cite{TFMultimerization} are also unlikely because the genome is highly condensed in the chromosome during mitosis.

Alternative splicing is common in intrinsically disordered regions mediating protein-protein interactions \cite{DisorderedRegionsAlternativeSplicing}. However, in many mammals, all of Knl1's MELT motifs within a single exon which is one of the longest internal exons in these mammals (\myref{ExonLength}). No alternatively splicing has been recorded for this region. The splicing machinery has to deploy specific mechanisms to splice long exons like this correctly \cite{InternalExon}.

    \noindent\justifying All putative MELT motifs identified in \cite{MELTEvolution} reside within a single exon and all recorded alternative splice variants of \protein{Knl1} contain this exon in listed mammals. Coordinates of exons (of mouse and human) in the CCDS Database \cite{CCDS} were accessed on May 21, 2020. Exons from coding sequences with either a ``Public'' or a ``Reviewed, update pending'' status were pooled. Redundant entries were removed (because various coding sequences may share a common exon) and the ranking of the MELT motif-encompassing exon was calculated. Due to the lack of data for untranslated regions, only internal exons were included in the analysis. It should be noted that the maximum length of an exon is restricted by the length of the respective protein, and \protein{KNL1} is a long protein of \SI{2342}{} amino acids (the canonical isoform). In a non-canonical isoform of human \protein{Knl1}, this MELT motif-encompassing exon is 166 bases shorter, but still includes all 19 putative MELT motifs.

\section{Cooperativity and ultrasensitivity}

Originally, ``cooperativity'' was used to described the binding of oxygen molecules to the multi-subunit hemoglobin \cite{KNF, MWC}. Cooperativity may amplify the signal or at least sensitize the output by reducing the dampening effect of any changes in the input \cite{CooperativityQA}. To explain such dampening effect, suppose that the output $f(x) \geq 0$ is a monotonically increasing and strictly concave function of the input $x$ for all $x \geq 0$ (like the Langmuir adsorption equation or the Michaelis-Menten kinetics) and that the output is 0 if and only if the input is 0. Comparing the outputs [$f(x_2)$ and $f(x_1)$] corresponding to the inputs ($x_2 > x_1 > 0$), we have

\begin{equation*}
    1 < \dfrac{f(x_2)}{f(x_1)} = \dfrac{f(x_2)}{f[\dfrac{x_1}{x_2} \cdot x_2 + (1-\dfrac{x_1}{x_2}) \cdot 0]} < \dfrac{f(x_2)}{\dfrac{x_1}{x_2}f(x_2) + (1-\dfrac{x_1}{x_2})f(0)} = \dfrac{x_2}{x_1},
\end{equation*}

\noindent which states that the contrast between the outputs is less than the contrast between the inputs \cite{InhibitorUltrasensitivity}. Due to the wide applicability of the Langmuir adsorption equation or the Michaelis-Menten kinetics in biochemical interactions or reactions, the dampening effect may actually be very common.

There are many well-studied mechanisms (including cooperativity) deployed by signaling cascades exhibiting a switch-like sigmoidal dose-response relationship (ultrasensitivity) to circumvent the dampening effect. Regarding the SAC signaling, certain mechanisms (like the cascade amplification mechanism; see \myref{SACRole}) may be excluded based on our current understanding of mitosis and the biochemical pathway of the SAC, while the multi-step/multi-site phosphorylation mechanism has been implied in the SAC by experimental evidence \cite{MultistepUltrasensitivity, Ji2017eLife}. My thesis will focus on the implied role of cooperativity in the SAC signaling. The term ``positive cooperativity'' (henceforth simply referred to as ``cooperativity'') describes the phenomenological synergy which I attribute to increased local concentration of SAC proteins due to their co-localization on the same signaling scaffold (see my models in \myref{ProzoneEffectModel,FinalKnittingModel}. This is reminiscent of the theoretical explanation of the avidity between antibodies and antigens \cite{AvidityMath}, another well-characterized example of cooperativity.

% Challenges
% The understanding of the entire picture is hindered by multiple difficulties. First, the biochemical reactions that lead to MCC formation are spatially localized within the nanoscale volume of a kinetochore. Second, the concentrations of many SAC proteins are tightly regulated and may be influenced by each other. Third, that the biochemical cascade involves complex parallel recruitment pathways of certain SAC proteins and regulating kinases/phosphatases. 

%To study the quantitative relationship between the strength of the SAC signaling and the number of signaling kinetochores/the amount of SAC proteins localized to signaling kinetochores, The SAC was then activated by treating the cells with either GSK923295 or a high dosage of nocodazole. GSK923295 inhibits the ATPase activity of \protein{Cenp-E}, thereby disrupting chromosome congression and yielding small numbers of chromosomes near spindle poles in mammalian cells \cite{GSK923295}.
% when applied at 75 nM -- 236 nM used in this study
%These polar chromosomes typically possess one kinetochore that is unattached or laterally attached to spindle microtubules, both of which activate the SAC in mammalian cells \cite{GSK923295MonastrolCotreatment,GSK923295LateralAttachmentEM,LateralAttachmentSAC}.
% Monastrol co-treatment may have created the bias towards unattachment instead of lateral attachment.
%Nocodazole affects the dynamics of microtubules and distorts spindles at \SI{330}{nM} in human cells \cite{TypeIIISpindle_330nMNoc, RPE1+Noc}, turning on SAC signaling at almost all kinetochores based on the recruitment of SAC proteins (see below). We applied various fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to quantify SAC proteins and their influence on the SAC in live cells \cite{eSAC}. % Small numbers of signaling kinetochores and relative enrichment of SAC proteins on them.
