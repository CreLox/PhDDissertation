To synchronize at the beginning of S phase, asynchronous populations were treated with 2.5 mM Thymidine for 16 hours, released from the thymidine block for 9 hours, treated again with 2.5 mM Thymidine for 16 hours, and finally released from the second thymidine block.

For short-term imaging (< 6 hours), cells were shifted to Fluorobrite media supplemented with 10\% FBS and 1\% P/S. High resolution time-lapse imaging was conducted on a Nikon Ti-U inverted microscope equipped with a 100x, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective, Lumencor light engine for fluorescence excitation, and an Andor iXon DV897 EMCCD camera. MetaMorph 7.6 was used to drive the microscope and to run multi-position time-lapse experiments. In these experiments, cells grown on glass-bottom dishes were treated 500 nM rapamycin for 1 hour prior to imaging. Cells with a visible mCherry signal were selected for time-lapse imaging. During the imaging session, a bright-field, mNeonGreen, and mCherry image was acquired every 2 minutes for a total duration of âˆ¼2 hours.
