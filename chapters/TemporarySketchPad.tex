% First, \protein{Mad1} in its fold-back conformation physically positions the MIM of \protein{Cdc20} and \protein{Mad2} closely, facilitating their association. Second, the cooperative interaction between the scaffold protein \protein{Mad1} in its fold-back conformation and \protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2} favors the formation of the \protein{Mad1}RWD-\protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2}-\protein{Mad1}MIM complex. Third, the extended conformation breaks such avidity binding and promotes the release of \protein{Cdc20}-\protein{Mad2} into the cytosol. However, future studies are needed to fill in the gaps between our current experimental evidence and the ``knitting'' model.
