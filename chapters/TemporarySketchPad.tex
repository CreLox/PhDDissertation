Recruitment of BubR1 by Bub1 per se contributes to the activity of the kinetochore-based SAC signaling. A Micrographs of representative cells displaying the indicated antigens at the top. The top row displays micrographs of the partially genome-edited cell line expressing mNG-BubR1. The bottom two rows display representative cells after endogenous BubR1 was knocked down and the indicated mutant, mNG-tagged version was ectopically expressed (scale bar ~ 1.22 microns). B Scatterplot on the left displays the duration of mitosis (in the presence of 25 nM nocodazole) of either genome-edited mNG-BUBR1 cells or cells that ectopically expressed the indicated mutant after the treatment of BubR1 siRNA. Scatterplot on the right displays the average cytosolic mNeonGreen signal from the same cells (mean Â± 95% confidence intervals).
