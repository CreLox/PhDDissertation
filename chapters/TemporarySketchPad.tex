\section{suggests synergy between multiple MELTs on a \protein{Knl1} phosphodomain}

The disproportionately large increase in the signaling strength of the recombinant \protein{Knl1} phosphodomain with multiple MELT motifs indicates synergistic activity. Because if each MELT motif on a \protein{Knl1} phosphodomain generates the MCC independently, then eSAC activators with recombinant phosphodomains containing larger numbers of MELT motifs will simply approach the limit imposed by SAC protein(s) at lower eSAC abundance (Figure 4F). This synergy enables the phosphodomain to generate MCC at a significantly higher rate than that achievable by independent signaling by the MELT motifs. As the concentration of the eSAC activator complex increases, these complexes compete with one another to recruit SAC proteins from the limited pool available in the cell. Individual eSAC activator complexes can no longer recruit multiple SAC proteins, and their synergistic activity weakens. This lead to the gradual decline in the response observed with increasing concentrations of the eSAC activator complex (Figures 4B and 4C).
